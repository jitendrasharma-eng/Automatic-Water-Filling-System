# Automatic-Water-Filling-System
The Automatic Water Filling System is designed to monitor and control the water level in a Tank/pot using an ultrasonic sensor (USS) and infrared (IR) sensors. The system activates a solenoid valve when the water level is low and deactivates it when the tank/pot reaches the desired level.
